title: Rails 6 + Tailwind CSS
author: Steve

I won't try to convince you to use Tailwind CSS in your next project,
Adam Wathan (the creator of Tailwind CSS), makes a much better case than I could;
by describing his jounrey through various different approaches to CSS, which 
eventually led him to create Tailwind. I will however, show you how easy it is
to get a new Rails 6 project setup with Tailwind CSS.
